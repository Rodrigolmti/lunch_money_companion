    <h3>API Usage</h3>

        purpose of data retrieval and display within our app.
    </p>
    <h3>Data Privacy</h3>
    <p>
        Your privacy is paramount to us. We assure you that our app does not store, collect, or

    <p>
        Rodrigo Lopes Martins is not liable for any data inaccuracies, loss of data, or any other
        issues arising from the use of the Lunch Money API. The app acts as a conduit for displaying
        your financial data and does not modify or interact with your data beyond this.
    </p>

        These terms are subject to change at any time. Users will be notified of any changes to the
