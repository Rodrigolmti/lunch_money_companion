    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which Lunch Money Companion (referred to as "we,"
        "us," or "our") collects, uses, maintains, and discloses information collected from users
        (referred to as "you" or "your") of our Android mobile application.
    </p>
    <h3>Data Collection and Usage</h3>
    <p>
        Our app utilizes Firebase Crashlytics to log and analyze app crashes for the purpose of
        improving user experience and app stability. Additionally, we use the Lunch Money API to
        access and display your financial data. We do not
        have any affiliation or partnership with Lunch Money. The use of their API is solely for the
        purpose of data retrieval and display within our app.
    </p>
    <p>
        We do not collect, store, or share any of your personal information. All data displayed in
        the app is fetched in real-time from the Lunch Money API and is not recorded or stored by
        our application. We do not track your activity within the app, and we do not use cookies or
        any other tracking technologies.
    </p>
    <h3>User Account Credentials</h3>
    <p>
        As a user, you are responsible for the security of your Lunch Money account credentials. Our
        app only uses these credentials to access the API and does not store them. We strongly
        advise you to keep your login information secure and not share it with anyone.
    </p>
    <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
    <p>
        Our app may include links or access to third-party services or websites, such as the Lunch
        Money website. Please be aware that these third-party sites have their privacy policies and
        terms of service, which are beyond our control. We are not responsible for the practices or
        content of these external sites.
    </p>
    <h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
    <p>
        Our app is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect
        personal information from children under 13.
    </p>
    <h3>Changes to Privacy Policy</h3>
    <p>
        We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes to the
        policy will be posted on this page, and the date of the last revision will be updated at the
        top of this page. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay
        informed about how we are protecting your information.
